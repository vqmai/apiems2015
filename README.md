### Abstract
```
Electronic business (e-business) is the execution of business transactions over the Internet-based communication and processes. This web-based approach of conducting business breaks the traditional paradigms of how logistics and supply chains are designed and managed to achieve success. In today's low growing and highly competitive market environment, motivating old customers to make repurchase with the firms is increasingly as important as attracting new customers. In e-commerce retail industry, electronic logistics performance has become important determinant for satisfying customers’ expectation and affecting consumers’ later purchasing behaviors. Moreover, post-purchase service becomes an important factor for evaluating both customer behavioral return intention and performance of logistic service. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether post-purchase service has any moderating influence on the relationship between logistics performance and customer repurchase intention in e-business environment. Post-purchase service is defined in terms of the ease to return products if there is any problem occurs. The empirical analysis for this study uses data collected from online retailers’ overall scores that are evaluated based on customers’ actual shopping experiences. A sample size of 312 useable responses was utilized. The results in this paper show that post-purchase plays a significant role in moderating the relationship between logistics performance and customer repurchase intention.
